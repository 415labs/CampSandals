Lightweight sandals for ultralight backpacking (3D printed lightweight sandals)

I've tried a few different commercially-available lightweight sandals, but I found them to be either too bulky, too heavy, or just not comfortable enough. So, I decided to design my own - and share with the community.
These sandals are designed to be:
- (Ultra)light: Weighing in at a mere 80 grams each, you can make them even lighter by reducing the infill and/or top/bottom layers.
- Packable: Super flat (11mm thick) for easy storage in your pack
- Comfortable: A barefoot feel with a comfortable, flexible design.
- Durable: Made from TPU filament for comfort and long-lasting use.
- Superior grip: the sole includes an aggressive tread pattern to provide traction on challenging terrain.
- Best of all, they're completely free to download and print at home: here or https://makerworld.com/en/models/797936#profileId-737339
- Note: This design is sized for a US Men's size 9 shoe. You can easily scale it up or down to fit your size using your slicer software.

Assembly:
Prepare the Front Strap:
- Cut a 100mm length of paracord.
- Thread both ends through the front hole of the sandal.
- Slide a washer onto the paracord from the sole side.
- Heat both ends of the paracord with a lighter or heat gun.
- Flatten the heated ends onto the washer using a flat metal tool (ruler). Be cautious to avoid burns.

Create the Side Strap:
- Cut a 520mm length of paracord.
- Thread both ends through side attachment points.
- Tie a knot to secure the strap (Refer to the included photos for a visual guide.)
- Heat both ends of the paracord.
- Join the heated ends together to close the loop. Again, be careful not to burn yourself.
